<h2>1st Website that I'm creating!</h2>
<p>
So, let's see how this works!
</p><p>
I'm following Derek suggestions and using his template.
I choosed GitHub to host this project to avoid spending $ now on hosting the domains I bought.
</p><p>
Oh, and about domains, I really enjoy the PorkBun site. Way more clear and friendly than OVH.pt
</p><p>
It's not that scary to write on this. :)
</p><p>
I'm planning to watch some tutorias about HTML and CSS to understand what other commands I can use.
</p><p>
After that, I'll create a profile page to put my CV in there.
</p><p>
You can find more about me here: <a href="about.html">Who?</a>.
</p><p>
That's it for now.
